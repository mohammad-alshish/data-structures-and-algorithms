# Reverse an Array


## Challenge01
Take list as an argument and reverse it without using any built-in Python reverse functions.

## Approach & Efficiency
We kept it simple by creating a function that takes in a single list as an argument. We decided to use slicing to reverse the list because it results in short, easy-to-read code. Big O was O(N) - grows linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
