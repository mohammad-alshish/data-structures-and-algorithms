## Challenge11

1. Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

2. enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

3. dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency
For the two methods we write them as simple as possible so we can keep the complextiy as samll as possible.
1. Enqueue
    - Space: O(1)
    - Time: O(1)
2. Dequeue
    - Space: O(n)
    - Time: O(n)
